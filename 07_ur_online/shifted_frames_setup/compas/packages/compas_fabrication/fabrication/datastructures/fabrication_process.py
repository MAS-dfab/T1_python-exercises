    This class helps to plan, visualize and control the fabrication process. 
    A fabrication process consists of several jobs that can be performed one 
    after the other, or, run in parallel. The sequence of the process is defined 
    through the starting job and the transitions between the jobs (e.g. job1 and
    job2). Those transitions may have also a certain conditions implemented, which 
    is by default that job2 can be only performed, when job1 is done. A job can 
    consist of several tasks, that are specific to the fabrication process.
