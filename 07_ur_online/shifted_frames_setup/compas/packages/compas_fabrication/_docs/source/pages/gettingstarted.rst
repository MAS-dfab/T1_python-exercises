Getting Started
********************************************************************************

This package builds on top of the `compas framework <http://block.arch.ethz.ch/docs/compas/core/>`_.
Make sure you followed `the installation steps described here <http://block.arch.ethz.ch/docs/compas/core/pages/gettingstarted.html>`_
to get the framework running and have the folder structure in place to install additional packages.

Once the setup is ready, clone the `compas fabrication <https://bitbucket.org/GramazioKohlerResearch/compas_fabrication>`_
package inside the ``packages`` folder. The end result should look like::

    .../compas/core
    .../compas/packages
    .../compas/packages/compas_fabrication


Install dependencies
====================
